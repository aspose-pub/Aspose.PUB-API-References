## Coord class

This class designed to represent data related to coordinates of PUB fields. Every field in PUB holds coordinates has 2 pairs of coordinates: coordinates of upper-left corner (XLeft, YTop) and coordinates of bottom-right corner(XRight, YBottom). All coordinates represented in special metric system - English Metric Unit(EMUs). Additional methods were added into this class to transform coordinate values from english metric units into inches.

```csharp
public class Coord : ICloneable
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [XLeft](../../aspose.pub.utils/coord/xleft/) { get; } | X-coordinate of upper-left corner in EMUs |
| [XRight](../../aspose.pub.utils/coord/xright/) { get; } | X-coordinate of bottom-right corner in EMUs |
| [YBottom](../../aspose.pub.utils/coord/ybottom/) { get; } | Y-coordinate of bottom-right corner in EMUs |
| [YTop](../../aspose.pub.utils/coord/ytop/) { get; } | Y-coordinate of upper-left corner in EMUs |

| [CalculateWidth](../../aspose.pub.utils/coord/calculatewidth/)() | Calculates width of figure(current Coord object) and returns result in inches |
| [CalculateX](../../aspose.pub.utils/coord/calculatex/#calculatex)() | Transforms value for X-coordinate from natural PUB metric system into inches |
| [CalculateX](../../aspose.pub.utils/coord/calculatex/#calculatex_1)(double) | Transforms value for X-coordinate from natural PUB metric system into inches |
| [CalculateY](../../aspose.pub.utils/coord/calculatey/#calculatey)() | Transforms value for Y-coordinate from natural PUB metric system into inches |
| [CalculateY](../../aspose.pub.utils/coord/calculatey/#calculatey_1)(double) | Transforms value for Y-coordinate from natural PUB metric system into inches |
| [Clone](../../aspose.pub.utils/coord/clone/)() | Created copy of object |
| [GetHeight](../../aspose.pub.utils/coord/getheight/)() | Returns height of current Coord object in natural PUB metrics |
| [GetWidth](../../aspose.pub.utils/coord/getwidth/)() | Returns width of current Coord object in natural PUB metrics |
