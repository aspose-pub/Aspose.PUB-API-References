## Coord class

This class designed to represent data related to coordinates of PUB fields. Every field in PUB holds coordinates has 2 pairs of coordinates: coordinates of upper-left corner (XLeft, YTop) and coordinates of bottom-right corner(XRight, YBottom). All coordinates represented in special metric system - English Metric Unit(EMUs). Additional methods were added into this class to transform coordinate values from english metric units into inches.

```csharp
public class Coord : ICloneable
```
